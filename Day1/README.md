Day 1 - 
-----
Challenge 1.1 - 
-------------
Write a function which gets the input string and prints out the statement.

Example -  
Hello, World!


Challenge 1.2 - 
-------------
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:  

If n is odd, print Weird  
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird  
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird  
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird  


Challenge 1.3 - 
-------------
Read two integers from STDIN, a and b. Print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.  
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).  
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.  

Example  
a = 3  
b = 5  

Print the following:  
8  
-2  
15  


Challenge 1.4 - 
-------------
Read two integers from STDIN, a and b. Print two lines where:

The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b.  
The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.  

No rounding or formatting is necessary.  

Example -   
a = 3  
b = 5  

The result of the integer division 3//5 = 0.  
The result of the float division is 3/5 = 0.6.  

Print the following:  
0  
0.6  


Challenge 1.5 - 
-------------
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the 
decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.  

Example -  
arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1]  
There are n=5 elements, 2 positive, 2 negative and 1 zero. Their ratios are -  
positive - 2/5 = 0.400000,  
negative - 2/5 = 0.400000,  
zero - 1/5 = 0.200000

Results should be printed as -  
0.400000  
0.400000  
0.200000

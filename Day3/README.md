Challenge 3.1 - 
-------------
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by 
summing exactly four of the five integers.  
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two 
space-separated long integers.

Example -  
arr = [1,3,5,7,9]

The minimum sum is 1+3+5+7=16 and the maximum sum is 3+5+7+9=24. The function prints -  
16 24

Challenge 3.2 - 
-------------
You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday.  
You have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of their total age.  
They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles.  
Count how many candles are tallest.

Example -   
candles = [4,4,1,3]  

The maximum height candles are 4 units high. There are 2 of them, so return 2.

Challenge 3.3 - 
-------------
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note:  
- 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

Example -  

s = '12:01:00PM'
Return '12:01:00'.

s = '12:01:00AM'
Return '00:01:00'.

Challenge 3.4 - 
-------------
Easy programs -  
1. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2. (easy1)
2. Read an integer n and print - "123...n". Example - n=5 , output = "12345". (easy2)
3. Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day,  
   you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores.  
   Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up. (easy3)
4. Given 3 integers x, y, z, and n, Print a list of all coordinates given by (i,j,k)  
   where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n and 0<=i<=x, 0<=j<=y, and 0<=k<=z, by using    
   list comprehension. (easy4)
5. Given an array of integers, find the sum of elements.

Challenge 3.5 - 
-------------
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Example -  
input -  
1 2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9  

Output -  
(1+5+9) - (3+5+7) = 0  

Challenge 3.6 - 
-------------
Staircase detail

This is a staircase of size n = 4:  
   $  
  $$  
 $$$  
$$$$  

Its base and height are both equal to n. It is drawn using $ symbols and spaces.  
The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
